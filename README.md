# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles

Yes they are quite short,
especially compared to your average Unix hacker,
And I intend to keep it as small as possible

## Scripts
These are Kakoune scripts that I consider "fun" more than practical.
They are not loaded by default,
for "minimalism"

They are preserved here for future learners,
and may be integrated into my core workflow anytime.
